# Blackjack-Simulator
Simulates games of Blackjack to find the best play, betting, and card counting strategies to earn the most money at casinos.

# Work in progress
The core blackjack simulation is mostly complete. I'm currently working on implementing card counting into the blackjack simulator. Configuration of the simulator is only possible in the code right now. I plan to have a user interface and command-line interface that can change any setting imaginable in the simulator.
